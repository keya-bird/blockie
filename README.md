### My Blockie
# Created my own personal Blockie and added to my portfolio.  A Blockie is a pixel representation and you can fork or download the blockie demo from this link here: https://github.com/johntango/hashDemoBlockies. 
## The demo explains how hashes can be used to create document signatures.
